I like to analyze data to answer research questions and test hypotheses. Currently I investigate questions related to water quality indexes as part of the ORISE Research fellow program in the care of the USEPA [USEPA Pacific Ecological Systems Divison (PESD)](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-pacific-ecological-systems-division-pesd). 

I graduated from [California State University at Monterey Bay](https://csumb.edu/) with a MS in Applied Marine and Watershed Science in 2019.
